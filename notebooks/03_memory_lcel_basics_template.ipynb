        "**Learning Goals:**\n",
        "- Understand conversational memory in LangChain\n",
        "- Compare memory types: Buffer vs Summary\n",
        "- Master LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) composition\n",
        "- Build streaming, retry, and fallback patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "**What we'll cover:**\n",
        "1. **Memory 101** - Buffer and Summary memory patterns\n",
        "2. **Memory in Chains** - Inject memory into conversational flows\n",
        "3. **LCEL Basics** - Compose runnables with `|` operator\n",
        "4. **Advanced LCEL** - Streaming, retry, fallbacks\n",
        "5. **Tool Use (Optional)** - Simple tool integration\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** This notebook focuses on fundamentals, not RAG. No ChromaDB or retrieval here.\n"
